# README
😊 Hi everyone, my name is Daniel Prado Amoretty and i'am a Software Engineer.

😉👌 I like to work dynamically, also working with a great team of partners or friends, because i think the art of code have to enjoy.

🐱‍👤 I am currently programming in Java 8, but I am building my project repository in Java 11.

🤔 The next step in my professional career is to build at least 3 projects 
that have to do with Java; in which you can use the deepest techniques and paradigms of language.

😏 I also have a bit of experience working with languages like C #, Visual Basic.net, with the MVC framework.

😬 I have a certification in Amazon Web Services as a Cloud Practitioner; 
in which I am looking for how to orient myself in the services for Developers or Solution Architect.

😓 The next step on my to-do list is to hone my understanding of the English language so that I am 100% understandable when speaking and listening.

🤓 I want to learn enough to orient myself to remote work and to be able to give solutions to those who are starting in this world of programming.

Things I like:
I like listening to music and dreaming that I hit those high notes.
I like to play basketball and Volleyball.

Soon you will see my projects.
